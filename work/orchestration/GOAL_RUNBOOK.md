# Goal Runbook

How to run a goal: what you do at each stage, what you write, where it goes, and who checks it. One document, whether a human or an agent is operating. There is no second copy of this file in a goal directory, and a goal directory never restates it.

This runbook states obligations, not decisions. What question is worth asking, which strategy to try, what a study result means, and when to stop are the operator's and the round agent's to argue. This file says only that they must be argued, in what shape, and where the argument lands.

**Why the layer is shaped this way** is in `.project/adr/` — seven records, listed at the end. This runbook cites them and does not restate them.

## What this is, and what it is not

A goal is a grounded question someone wants answered, pursued in rounds. A round is one agent's bounded attempt at one strategy. Under a strategy the round agent coordinates bounded tasks. Each round ends in a written result and a record of review coverage: independent review where triggered, or the evidence and reason that further review adds no coverage.

The goal layer decides *what to work on next and what the evidence means*. It does not do the work. The work happens in the native workflows — the coding PM in `.project/`, the modeling PM in `work/`, the research pipeline, the study runbook — and each of those keeps its own stage records exactly as it does today.

So the goal layer **cites, and never restates**. If you find yourself copying a work item's status, a study's numbers, or a spec's requirements into `trail.md`, stop: that is now a second copy that will disagree with the first. Write the path, write what it *meant* for the goal, and move on.

Three things this is not:

- **Not a plan.** A strategy carries no future task list. Tasks are chosen from the evidence in hand; parallel execution follows § Running one task.
- **Not a control plane.** There are no envelope files, no event ledger, no idempotency keys, and no digests that a procedure compares. That machinery is on a hardening path and is promoted only when a real run demonstrates prose failing, with the failure recorded (ADR-0003).
- **Not an automation of the owner's judgment.** Merge, push, item close, archive, and every reserved gate stay owner-held.

## The five surfaces

| Surface | The question it answers | Who writes it |
|---|---|---|
| `work/orchestration/goals/<goal>/goal.md` | What are we trying to answer, and what would count as answered? | The operator, with an agent, once |
| `work/orchestration/goals/<goal>/trail.md` | What has happened, and what was decided? | The round agent, append-only |
| `work/orchestration/goals/<goal>/learnings.md` | What does this run now know? | The round result proposes; closure accepts under the review rule below |
| `work/orchestration/GOAL_RUNBOOK.md` | How do I do the next thing? | This file. One copy |
| `.project/adr/` | Why is it this way? | Whoever decides, at the time |

Nothing is duplicated across them, so nothing can disagree. If you cannot find where something goes, it probably belongs in a native artifact and the trail should cite it.

Templates for the three goal files are at `work/orchestration/goal-templates/`. Copy them; the headings are the contract.

## What "fresh" means

When independent review is triggered, "fresh" has the owner's definition:

> **The critic is never the author's session.** — `[OWNER]`, `.project/concepts/goal-driven-model-development-harness.md:47` (success criterion 5)

That is a *session* boundary, not a work boundary. It is stronger than "someone who did not do the work," and the difference matters: an agent can honestly claim it did not do a particular piece of work while still carrying the whole round in its context. Reading your own round with your own reasoning still in front of you is not a review.

**Who obtains the reviewer, by path:**

- **A human operator** starts a new session for the reviewer, or asks a second person. Nothing else is needed.
- **A goal agent** may spawn a new reviewer subagent with no inherited conversation context. Deposit a self-contained brief and evidence references under `evidence/` before dispatch; no separate commit is required. A fork carrying the author’s conversation, or a resumed authoring agent, does not satisfy freshness. If a required fresh session cannot be obtained, park dependent work and hand back using the handoff below. See ADR-0003’s 2026-09-11 amendment for the independence boundary.

**If a fresh session is unavailable, the agent’s handoff is:** Append to `trail.md`:

```text
### Stop — YYYY-MM-DD
Kind: handoff
What is true on disk: <the native state, and what is ready to be reviewed>
What the owner must see: a fresh session is needed to review <the reading / the round>
The material to review: <paths>. Resume at <this runbook's section>.
```

Then stop dependent work. The operator or coordinator obtains the fresh session; that session picks up from the handoff and writes the required review entry. Independent work may continue within the goal's limits.

**An agent may not independently review work it authored.** The coordinator may record routine closure and reused evidence; label that as a coordinator check, never an independent verdict.

## Review scope and evidence reuse

[AGENT] Process sizing implements the owner's 2026-09-14 request to reduce harness overhead. These triggers replace the former unconditional checkpoint-plus-round-critic sequence. Grounding, scientific decisions reserved to the owner, source quarantine, immutable study evidence, and runtime contracts remain binding.

Any stage can be brief or skipped when its responsibility is already satisfied or does not apply. Record the reason and supporting evidence in the existing task or round entry. The main agent may execute stages directly or delegate scoped work.

| Concrete trigger | Required coverage |
|---|---|
| New or reinterpreted equation or source | Focused independent source/math check against original evidence before dependent scientific work |
| Changed ownership or interfaces, or a new modeling pattern | Focused independent design review before implementation |
| Shared definition changes | Enumerate consumers and check affected instances; broaden when impact is unknown |
| Coupled architecture, multiple model families, or failed coverage | Substantive independent integration audit across affected paths |
| Routine work with none of these triggers | Coordinator records applicable validation and why further review is unnecessary |

A scoped review brief states the exact question, entry files and sections, original evidence, expected checks, and exclusions. Default budget: six tool calls and a 300-word return. Do not recursively load project context. If named evidence is missing or the budget cannot establish coverage, return the specific missing evidence and uncertainty without a passing verdict. The coordinator may broaden the brief and budget for that concrete uncertainty; complex integration work needs substantial coverage, not an artificial six-call pass. Use a fresh self-contained session, never an inherited conversation fork. The same reviewer rechecks the corrective diff.

Reuse verified results when the revision, scope, and environment remain valid; cite what was checked and confirm those conditions. A review can cover native work, study interpretation, and goal dispositions where its evidence supports all three. Closure checks only the remaining coverage and changed evidence. Do not stack an administrator, checkpoint critic, native critic, and round critic over the same claim. An unresolved interpretation that changes scientific meaning goes to the owner's reserved gate; review cannot substitute for that decision.

## Grounding a goal

For a model-changing goal, read `modeling_project/REQUIREMENTS.md` and carry applicable requirements into its invariants. MR-7 governs design-variable assignment, automatic equipment selection and demand-versus-installed-capacity meaning. Grounding must identify the choices the goal is intended to preserve or investigate, not assume the current input/output split is authoritative. An existing grounded goal needs a dated amendment when a newly surfaced requirement changes its strategy; do not rewrite its historical contract.

**Do:** sit with the operator and write `goal.md` from the template. Everything in it is meant to be stable for the life of the goal, so take the time.

**Write:** the question, in one sentence, as a question. The consumer — who is asking and what they will do with the answer. Answered when — the condition that ends the goal, concrete enough that two people would agree it had been met. The invariants a comparison must preserve, so a later round cannot drift the meaning of "better". The grounding evidence — repository paths for what is already known. The limits (see § Limits). The reserved gates the owner keeps. The close rule, which is owner-held.

**Where:** `work/orchestration/goals/<goal>/goal.md`. The goal slug names the directory.

**Who checks it:** the operator, and any session asked to run the goal. A goal hollow in **any** of the five field classes — grounding evidence, answer contract (§ Answered when), invariants, limits, or reserved gates — is not grounded and **authorizes no task**, not one, not a small one: refuse to open a round or start a task, and name the missing class. Grounding evidence has the mechanical tell (empty means `Status: draft`); the other four are checked by reading the file. Grounding is what stops a run from spending a week on a question the repository already answered.

*(Amended 2026-08-27 `[OWNER]`. The shipped rule defended grounding evidence alone; a five-session probe measured cold sessions running full tasks on goals missing invariants, limits, or reserved gates — `.project/completed/20260827_goal-cold-pickup-proof/gate-probe-record.md`. Written rule promoted on that recorded failure, per the hardening rule.)*

Revisions to a grounded goal are rare and are written as dated amendments, never by editing what is there.

## Opening and closing a round

Before a strategy changes a design quantity's role, record its MR-7 justification and affected binding/consumer paths. Treat an automatic sizing policy or removal of a design choice as a modeling/interface decision, not routine arithmetic. Existing authorized choices can proceed; a premise conflict or an unresolved material owner choice stops only dependent work. Depth-target attainment and numerical regression success cannot substitute for the MR-7 assessment. For prospective depth work, also read `.project/active/demo-depth-rubric/application-policy.md`.

**Do:** open a round by writing one strategy revision. Then run tasks under it until the round closes.

**Write:** `## Round N — <strategy-slug>`, then `### Strategy revision — YYYY-MM-DD` carrying the approach, the assumptions it rests on, the conditions under which you would abandon it, the model increment you intend, and the study question you intend. **No future task list** (ADR-0001). If you can predict all the tasks, the strategy is a plan and the round has stopped being an experiment.

**A round is bounded.** At most one promoted pin and at most one committed study. A *pin* is the exact package version a study runs against — promoting one fixes what "the model" means for that study, so that two results are comparable. The study layer owns the term and its identity rules (`.claude/skills/run-study/runbook.md`; `modeling_project/STUDY_POLICY.md`). That is the bound that makes a round finite and comparable.

**A round closes on exactly one of six triggers:**

1. A valid study reading — including an adverse or inconclusive one. A disappointing study still closes the round; the follow-up belongs to the next one.
2. A strategy blocker — the premise the strategy rests on turned out to be wrong.
3. Changed comparison meaning — what "better" means moved, so results before and after are not comparable.
4. An owner gate that is not resolved.
5. A declared limit reached.
6. The goal answered.

A round may close with neither a pin nor a study. An honest empty round is a result.

**Write at close:** `### Round N result — YYYY-MM-DD` with intent met or unmet, the task sequence, the last semantic outcome, the stop reason, the evidence refs, the proposed learning delta, and the finding dispositions. The stop reason is **derived** — read it off the last semantic outcome plus the goal's limits. Do not maintain it as a second status; two enums drift.

**Where:** `work/orchestration/goals/<goal>/trail.md`, appended at the end. Every entry in this section and the ones that follow goes there, newest last, and no entry is ever edited in place — a correction is a dated `### Amendment` entry naming what it amends.

**Is this round open?** Read the headings. A round is open exactly when its `## Round N` section carries a `### Strategy revision` and no `### Round N result`. Nothing else records it, and nothing needs updating to keep it true.

**Who checks it:** the coordinator records closure coverage after the result; a fresh reviewer checks triggered risks not already covered.

## Running one task

A task is one bounded objective and may span several native stages. Tasks may run in parallel when write-conflict risk is low and neither task’s result is likely to invalidate the other’s scope or justification. Record that judgment and file ownership before dispatch. Each task retains its own scope, start, and return; the round agent integrates results sequentially and pauses affected work when new evidence undermines its justification.

**1. Write the scope, before any work.** `### T-00N scope`, six lines: Objective (one question or change), Why now (the connection to the strategy and the triggering evidence), Scope (what is authorized and what is explicitly excluded), Inputs (native refs; cite `goal.md` and state only any *narrower* constraint), Done when (a useful positive or a bounded negative), Stop when (prerequisite, strategy blocker, owner gate, or declared limit).

Scope is a reviewable record, not a technical sandbox. The coordinator checks scope on return; required independent reviews inspect the relevant scope too. An unresolved owner gate blocks dependent work.

**2. Write the start line, before the first native side effect.** `### T-00N start — YYYY-MM-DD`, one line: the task, the native target, and the artifact you expect. This is written *ahead* of the work so that an interruption leaves a trace of what was in flight.

**3. Do the work through the native workflow.** Routine native stage changes stay in native artifacts and create no goal entries. A spec being written, a plan phase being checked off, a validation running — none of that is a goal event.

For tasks affecting MR-7, include the requirement and intended design choices in every delegated modeling/review brief. At return, inspect the design-role record and applicable behavior-test evidence. Record compliance as compliant, violated or unverified; a modeled component, passing baseline or rubric score alone cannot establish it. Required independent design review covers the actual variable assignment and downstream bindings before dependent implementation; its integration recheck covers the executed behavior.

**4. Write the return.** `### T-00N return — YYYY-MM-DD` with the outcome, one of six:

| Outcome | Means | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `COMPLETE` | The objective was met | Choose the next task |
| `BOUNDED_NEGATIVE` | A real, useful "no" | A first-class result; choose the next task |
| `PREREQUISITE` | Something needed is missing | Ends the task, preserves strategy and comparison meaning; another scoped task may follow |
| `STRATEGY_BLOCKER` | The strategy's premise is wrong | **Closes the round** |
| `OWNER_GATE` | A reserved decision is needed | Stops until the owner rules |
| `MECHANICAL_FAILURE` | The machinery broke, the meaning did not | A retry is permitted, within the cap |

`PREREQUISITE` is *discovered as a return*, never predicted in a scope. A scope that lists its own prerequisites is a plan.

The return also carries the evidence refs, the goal-level reading of them, and five decision fields for every goal-level decision made: the finding or trigger; the decision and its reason; the tier (`execution detail | reserved gate | premise surprise`); who decided; and what changed, resolving to paths, ids, commits, or `none`. Those five fields are what make `trail.md` the replay record without a second ledger.

**Retry.** `MECHANICAL_FAILURE` permits a retry **only** when the task, its inputs, its scope, and its meaning are all identical — you are re-running the same thing after fixing the machinery. Write the retry as a new `### T-00N start` under the same id, recording the operational correction. It is not a new task and not a new entry kind. Past the retry cap, the task ends as a mechanical failure past cap, which is a blocker.

**Where:** `trail.md`, under the open round's `## Round N` heading, in the order written.

**Who checks it:** the coordinator on return, with independent review where § Review scope and evidence reuse requires it.

## The pre-execution disposition checkpoint

**When:** after a study reading produces proposed dispositions and before dependent follow-up, assess the triggers in § Review scope and evidence reuse. A checkpoint session is needed only for uncovered triggered risks or an explicit reserved gate.

**Do:** cite existing valid review coverage or record why a coordinator check suffices. For uncovered triggered risks, hand a bounded brief, the relevant reading and dispositions, and original evidence to a fresh reviewer. The author revises and the same reviewer checks the diff until it passes or the cap is hit.

**If a required independent review is unavailable, park dependent work.** Write the handoff from § What "fresh" means. A coordinator check cannot discharge triggered independent review or an owner-reserved gate.

**Write:** `### Checkpoint C-00N.rK — YYYY-MM-DD`, naming the reviewer, reading, dispositions, verdict, and changes. When no additional review is required, preserve these fields with a reasoned coordinator disposition and valid evidence references; never invent an independent verdict. Each submission is a new `rK` entry — `r1`, `r2`, `r3`. Never amend a previous one.

**Where:** `trail.md`, before the follow-up task's scope.

**Who checks it:** the assigned reviewer for uncovered risks. Closure cites this coverage without commissioning the same check again.

**The cap stops the work; it does not release it.** If the checkpoint has not passed after the declared number of revisions, write `### Stop — YYYY-MM-DD` of kind `cap`, naming the unresolved dispositions and what the owner has to decide. The round stops there. Hitting the cap never permits execution (ADR-0005).

Routine native stages get no separate goal critics. Reuse applicable native validation and review evidence.

## The fresh review

**When:** after the round result is written, and never before.

**Do:** the coordinator checks the list below against the round result and valid evidence already obtained. For uncovered triggered risks, commission a fresh review of those risks with a bounded brief. Broad integration triggers require substantial independent review across the affected paths. Independent reviews return `PASS`, `FINDINGS`, or `OWNER_GATE`; coordinator-only closure records its reason and is not an independent pass.

The coordinator may close routine rounds directly. If required independent coverage is unavailable, write the handoff from § What "fresh" means and park dependent work. A closed round is never reopened.

**What it checks:**

- Native evidence, by citation. Every ref resolves and says what the trail claims it says.
- Goal and strategy fidelity. Did the round pursue the strategy it declared?
- Every recorded task scope. Did the work stay inside it? Drift is not prevented; it is caught here.
- Retry classification. Was each retry genuinely mechanical, with task, inputs, scope, and meaning identical?
- **Every discovery row the round's evidence touched** — that its disposition landed, and that the finding actually moved. This is the post-execution audit; it lives here, not in a third critic (ADR-0005).
- Whether any cited native artifact moved outside its task (see § When a cited artifact moves).
- The learning delta — accepted, corrected, or rejected before it is appended to `learnings.md`.
- The constraints carried forward into the next strategy.

**Write:** `### Round N review — YYYY-MM-DD` with the reviewer and verdict, or `coordinator check; independent review skipped` and its reason; include checks, reused evidence, remaining uncertainty, and the recommendation.

**Where:** `trail.md`, after the round result. The accepted learning delta is appended to `learnings.md` at the same time, and nowhere else.

**The review never resumes the closed round.** If it finds work left undone, that is the next round's, and it says so.

After coverage is complete, the coordinator or reviewer recommends the owner-held close or writes the next strategy revision, opening round N+1. The owner retains the goal's close rule.

## Timing of review coverage

Pre-execution reasoning and post-execution results answer different questions. They do not automatically require different reviewers or sessions.

| | Disposition checkpoint | Round review |
|---|---|---|
| **When** | Before any semantic follow-up task executes | After the round closes |
| **Over what** | Uncovered triggered risks in one reading and its dispositions | Remaining coverage and changed evidence; affected paths for integration risk |
| **Asks** | Is this reading right, and do these dispositions follow from it? | Did the round stay inside its scope, classify its retries honestly, land every disposition, and learn the right thing? |
| **Reviewer** | Fresh non-author when triggered; otherwise coordinator with evidence | Coordinator; independent reviewer only for uncovered triggered risks |
| **On failure** | Author revises and resubmits, up to the cap; then a recorded stop | `FINDINGS` or `OWNER_GATE`; the round stays closed |
| **Loops?** | Yes, capped | No |

## When a cited artifact moves

A task's authority rests on the native artifacts it cited. If one of them changed outside that task, the task no longer has authority — work done after the change rests on a premise that moved.

**Do:** at two moments — when resuming, and at round review — walk the trail's cited refs and check each against the native artifact's own current state. The work item's status and its stage record. The study record's committed state. `git log` on the path. You are reading the native artifact to see whether it moved; that is all.

**Write, if one moved:** `### Stop — YYYY-MM-DD` of kind `external mutation`, naming the ref, what changed, and which task it voids. Then either re-ground the goal or close the round. No further work under that task.

**Who checks it:** the resumer and the coordinator at closure, with independent review where triggered.

**This is a reading, not a machine check.** No goal procedure compares a cited digest against a stored or computed one, and no goal procedure recomputes one — that mechanism is the stale-authority guard on the hardening path, barred until a real run shows this reading failing (ADR-0003, ADR-0006). **Digests are read by people.** A citation digest tells a reader which version was cited; that is its whole job.

**Writing a citation.** For a tracked artifact, `<path>@<commit-sha>`. Git already supplies the content digest, so nothing new is needed. For evidence that is not tracked, cite the tracked native record that already hashes it: a study store is cited through its committed record directory `@<sha>`, whose `snapshot.json` carries the store identity and fingerprints; an R2-synced research binary is cited through its tracked extracted markdown `@<sha>`. Where nothing native hashes it, cite the path and write **"unpinned; no native digest"** in the citation, so a reader can see the citation pins nothing rather than mistake it for one that does.

## Resuming an interruption

On resume, inspect every invocation with no return or stop, including parallel tasks. You will see each as a `### T-00N start` with no matching `### T-00N return` and no stop.

**Do, in this order:**

1. Read `goal.md`, then the trail from the top of the open round. Identify every unfinished task and its authorized scope; establish whether any worker is still running before resuming its work.
2. **Inspect the native artifacts as truth.** Whatever the trail says was expected, the native artifact says what actually happened. Look at the work item, the study record, the commits.
3. Walk the round's cited refs for external mutation (§ When a cited artifact moves).
4. Write either the missing return — if the native evidence shows the task reached an outcome — or `### Stop — YYYY-MM-DD` of kind `interruption`, saying what was in flight and what the native state shows.

**Never** re-run completed native work because the trail does not mention it. The native artifact is the truth; the trail is the judgment.

## Limits

| Limit | Default | What happens at the cap |
|---|---|---|
| Retry cap (`MECHANICAL_FAILURE` → retry) | **2 retries** (3 attempts) | The task ends as mechanical failure past cap — a blocker |
| Checkpoint revision cap | **2 revisions** (3 submissions) | `### Stop` of kind `cap`; the round stops. Execution is **not** permitted |
| Round limit (general goals) | **6 rounds** | The goal is re-grounded with the operator, or closed |
| Tasks per round | **none** | Already bounded by one pin, one study, and mandatory close after a valid reading |

Every goal restates these numbers in its own `Limits` section, explicitly. They are never inherited silently, because a reader of `goal.md` must be able to see the run's limits without leaving the file. **A goal may declare tighter or looser values, and the declared value wins.**

## The discovery log

`exploration/<pkg>/studies/DISCOVERY_LOG.md` is the study producer's record of findings, one row per finding sighting, joined to a committed record's § 15 by `<study-id>#<n>`. This is the goal layer's **own pen's** one write outside the goal directory. Work a task performs through a native workflow's own operation — a `pm add-item`, a spec written through the owning PM — is that workflow's write, not the goal layer's (§ What this is, and what it is not).

*(Amended 2026-08-27. The prior sentence — "a goal round has exactly one write outside its own directory" — contradicted this file's own routing of findings to native work items through the owning PM. The reading above was recorded before the Item 4 proof run and validated in it: the round agent read it the same way unprompted.)*

**What a round owes.** Every open row the round's evidence touched gets a disposition: one of `model fix | research | declared seam | upstream filing`, its status, the responsible task or owner, and what changed or the concrete next reference. **No touched row returns as `unrouted`** (ADR-0004).

**How to write it.** Append a new row under the *same* `<study-id>#<n>` id. Never edit a first-sighting row — that is the executor's account and it stands as written. Row kind is positional: for a given id, the earliest row in file order is the sighting and later rows are disposition updates. No column marks it.

**How to read it.** Scan the whole file **for the id**, and take the newest matching row as that finding's current state. Do not stop at the first row you hit; the first row is the sighting, and the sighting is exactly the state you are trying to update.

**Never mint an id.** A goal round may append only under an id a committed record's § 15 already carries. A row citing an unknown id breaks the join and fails `tests/study/test_records.py::test_findings_join_the_discovery_log` for that record.

**A finding the round discovers itself is not a discovery-log row.** It has a home, and the trail cites it: `learnings.md` if it is accepted meaning; a native work item through the owning PM if it is work; the research seam if it is a question; an ADR if it is a decision. If it genuinely needs to be a log row, it needs a study to sight it.

## The native seams

What a round invokes, and what it gets back. The two `study.*` seams are the study layer's; its obligations, step by step, are in `.claude/skills/run-study/runbook.md`, and its rules are in `modeling_project/STUDY_POLICY.md`. A goal round invokes that runbook and reads what it deposits — it never restates its steps here.

| Seam | Invoke with | Native return | The goal-level question |
|---|---|---|---|
| `research` | question, evidence, source and search limits | registered sources, a queued candidate, or a bounded negative | Is the evidence enough? |
| `model` | bounded change objective, work item, goal invariants | audited item or blocker | Did it land without comparison drift? |
| `integrate` | audited item(s), expected lineage | verified `CANDIDATE` pin and fingerprints, or a named `BLOCKER` | Is there one study-ready candidate? |
| `study.execute` | pin, question, protocol rulings | committed study record or blocker | Did it run against the exact contract? |
| `study.read` | committed record only | native synthesis and findings | What does the evidence establish? |

**Every seam is native now. A goal round still may not silently absorb a seam repair.**

- **`research`** is native: `scripts/source_registry.py` is the one write door into `knowledge/`, `scripts/research_seam.py` carries a bounded request and computes its return from receipts on disk, and `/research-acquire` drives search and triage between them. Operator guide: `docs/research_seam_operator_guide.md`. (Repaired by GSTH Item 2; row flipped on the first live registrations — WI-033, 2026-08-28.)
- **`integrate`** is native: `scripts/integrate.py` proves regeneration → verification → pin in one invocation and returns exactly one `CANDIDATE` pin and fingerprints or a named `BLOCKER`; it performs nothing and commits nothing (ADR-0009 — a fixed-point proof, not a mutator). Operator guide: `docs/integration_seam_operator_guide.md`. (Repaired by GSTH Item 3; row flipped on the first live goal-round invocation — GSTH Item 6, goal `p-pump-fence`, 2026-08-29.)

"May not silently absorb" means: if a task finds itself repairing a seam rather than invoking its documented procedure, that is a `PREREQUISITE` return naming the seam, not a quiet expansion of scope. A seam repair has its own owner and its own failure contract.
