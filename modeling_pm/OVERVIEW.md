# Project Overview

**Project**: Fusion TEA
**Purpose**: SysML v2 models for fusion power plant LCOE estimation
**Start Date**: 2026-01-05
**Status**: Active

---

## What We're Building

<!-- Describe what you're building and why -->

SysMLv2 models of nuclear fusion power plants that enable:

1. **Formal Integration** - Connect behavior (what system does), structure (how it's built), and physics (natural phenomena)
2. **Validation Framework** - Constraint-based checking against physical laws and engineering limits
3. **Design Exploration** - Parametric studies and trade-space analysis
4. **Bottom-Up Analysis** - LCOE estimation from component specifications

**Reference Implementation**: CATF MFE (Compact Advanced Tokamak Fusion)
**Validation Baseline**: PyFECONS costing algorithms

## Why SysMLv2?

Traditional engineering analysis tools use:
- Empirical scaling laws
- Spreadsheet-based calculations
- Limited traceability
- Difficult to explore design variations

SysMLv2 enables:
- Explicit architecture and behavior modeling
- Formal constraint checking
- Direct component-to-analysis mapping
- Reusable component libraries
- Multi-concept comparison

## Technical Approach

For MBSE methodology including the Four Integrated Views (Requirements, Behavioral, Structural, Analysis), see [MODELING_PROCESS.md](MODELING_PROCESS.md).

For SysML syntax and patterns, see [MODELING_GUIDE.md](MODELING_GUIDE.md).

## Technology Stack

**Core Tools**:
- **SysIDE** - SysML v2 parsing and validation (via `syside` CLI)
- **Python 3.11+** - Scripting and analysis
- **Git** - Version control
- **agentic-mbse** - MBSE workflow commands and validation
- **sysml-codegen** - Code generation from SysML models

## Project Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Model complexity overwhelms | Strict modularity, progressive elaboration |
| Tooling immature | Use stable parser features, hybrid approach |
| Physics fidelity insufficient | Validate against high-fidelity codes |
| Validation gap | Compare with baseline, calibrate factors |
| Scope creep | AGILE backlog, approval gates |

## Getting Started

**For new collaborators**:
1. Read this overview
2. Review `MODELING_GUIDE.md` for SysML syntax
3. Review `MODELING_PROCESS.md` for workflow
4. Look at `backlog/BACKLOG.md` for work items
5. Examine example models in `models/library/`

**For agents working on this project**:
1. Read this overview and MODELING_GUIDE first
2. Check `active/` for current priorities
3. Follow modeling conventions strictly
4. Document sources and traceability
5. Validate incrementally
