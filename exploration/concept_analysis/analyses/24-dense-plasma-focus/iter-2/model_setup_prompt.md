# 1costingfe Model Update: Dense Plasma Focus (LPP Fusion)

## Mode: Feedback Pass (Edit Existing Model)

An existing three-forward model from a prior iteration has been copied to `C:\Users\mallo\Deterministic_Concept_scoring\fusion-tea\exploration\concept_analysis\analyses\24-dense-plasma-focus\iter-2\model_setup.py`.

**Your task**: Read the existing model at `C:\Users\mallo\Deterministic_Concept_scoring\fusion-tea\exploration\concept_analysis\analyses\24-dense-plasma-focus\iter-2\model_setup.py` and apply
**targeted edits** based on the assessment findings below. Use the Edit tool — do
NOT rewrite the file from scratch, and do NOT restructure conforming code.

## Preserve the three-forward contract

The file already follows the canonical shape; keep it:
1. `spec` dict (design-point inputs only) + `P_native`
2. `model = CostModel(...)`
3. `generic = generic_reference(model, spec, P_native)` — the mandatory
   overrides-off forward (forward 1), the reference a relative override is written against
4. `overrides = [ ... ]` — six-field registry entries
5. `native, result_1gw = run_native_and_1gw(model, spec=spec, overrides=overrides, p_native=P_native)`

with `model`, `generic`, `native`, `result_1gw` at module level and the
`print_cas_breakdown(generic, native, result_1gw, overrides)` call retained. Do
not convert the helper call into an inline two-knob `forward()` (the contract
validator rejects it), do not drop the mandatory `generic` line, and do not
re-introduce `# DEFAULT:` comments or the uniform financial parameters
(`availability`, `lifetime_yr`, `interest_rate`, `inflation_rate`) into `spec`.
**Do not re-introduce power-conversion efficiencies (`eta_th`, `eta_de`,
`eta_dec`) into `spec`** — these are ENUM-driven; the way to express a
different value is to add an upstream ENUM member in costingfe, not a per-
concept override. `f_dec` (DEC fraction) MAY appear in `spec` with provenance —
it's a physics+architecture property, not a hardware-efficiency claim.
A relative override references `generic` (never `native` or `result_1gw`).

**Low archetype-fit concepts: do not empty `spec`.** When the frontmatter
declares `Archetype-Fit: Low`, the prior model may still have a populated `spec`
expressing the concept's actual geometry / physics using canonical kwargs (even
where the archetype isn't a perfect cost match). **Preserve those entries** and
only edit specific fields if a finding calls for it. Replacing a populated
low-fit `spec` with `spec = dict()` is a regression — the library would fall
back to pure archetype YAML defaults that carry zero signal for this concept's
actual machine. Cost-side overrides (the registry below) are where the "Low
fit" caveat properly lives.

**Archetype-specific spec key blocklist (library-bug workarounds).** Until library issues are
fixed, some spec keys must not be passed for specific archetypes — even when the published design
point has a value for them. If the prior model contains any of these keys in `spec`, **remove
them** as part of this edit:
- **DIPOLE**: remove `plasma_volume` if present. The MFE radiation calc treats `plasma_volume`
  as a uniform integrator and over-counts radiation for dipole-peaked profiles. Library issue:
  **1cFE/1costingfe#24**. Document the removal with a brief comment citing the issue.

**Override values are M$, never raw dollars** (validator rejects `|value| > 5e4`).
**Derived rollup accounts cannot be overridden**: C220111, C220000, C220100,
C220200, C220300, C220400, C220500, C220600, C220700. To express "this concept
assembles more simply," override `installation_frac` via `costing_overrides`,
not the C220111 dollar amount.
**Disabled overrides must carry a `blocked_by` field** matching `<org>/<repo>#<NN>`
(e.g. `"1cFE/1costingfe#42"`) so library-side findings route to a tracker
instead of dying in the rationale text.
**Every override must declare `cost_basis: "noak"` (strict).** The framework runs
`noak=True`; any other vintage (`foak`, `conceptual_design`, `vendor_target`,
`unspecified`) is rejected. If your source publishes a non-NOAK value, either
(a) disable + `blocked_by`, (b) apply a documented learning-curve adjustment in
`rationale` and declare `cost_basis: "noak"`, or (c) file a tracker issue.

**Rules**:
- Preserve all existing sweeps, scenarios, and sensitivity analyses unless a
  finding specifically says to change them.
- Add content incrementally; every change must be traceable to a specific finding
  or a direct consequence of one.
- Any override you add or change uses a **canonical** account code (schema below)
  and the six-field shape; keep `provenance` honest and show derivation arithmetic
  in `rationale`.


## Assessment Findings

Focus on findings tagged `Category: model`. Findings tagged `Category: analysis`
are informational (the analysis agent handles prose), but you may adjust model
parameters if an analysis finding implies the model's assumptions are wrong.

### F-1: Section 7 contradicts the upstream-fixed confinement family
- **Target:** Section 7 (Family-Delta vs Comparables)
- **Category:** analysis
- **Finding:** The frontmatter fixes `Confinement-Family: MFE`, but Section 7 opens with "The Dense Plasma Focus is classified under confinement family 'Other' — it does not fit cleanly into MFE, IFE, MIF, or Electrostatic categories." The analysis instructions explicitly state that the confinement family is fixed upstream and must not be re-decided. By claiming a different family, Section 7 undermines the delta framework: instead of articulating how this concept differs *within* or *against* the MFE family (and the fixed — albeit empty — comparables list), it argues for a reclassification that is outside the analysis agent's authority.
- **Recommendation:** Remove the "classified under confinement family 'Other'" assertion. Accept the upstream MFE classification and reframe the family-delta prose to articulate how the DPF's self-confinement, pulsed operation, lack of external magnets, and direct energy conversion create specific subsystem-level cost deltas relative to conventional MFE concepts (which the analysis already does in the subsequent paragraphs — the opening claim is the problem, not the body of the comparison).
- **Priority:** important

### F-2: CAS80 override value uses raw dollars in analysis YAML but M$ in model_setup.py
- **Target:** Section 5b (Override Candidates) CAS80 entry and model_setup.py CAS80 override
- **Category:** analysis
- **Finding:** The analysis Section 5b YAML specifies `value: 30000.0` for CAS80 (annualized fuel cost), which in the model framework's M$ convention would mean $30 billion/year. The model_setup.py correctly uses `value: 0.03` (i.e., $30,000/year = 0.03 M$/year). The rationale in both artifacts derives the same $30,000/year figure, so the intent is clear, but the analysis YAML value is inconsistent with the model's unit convention. If the analysis YAML were consumed literally by a downstream tool, the result would be off by six orders of magnitude.
- **Recommendation:** Change the analysis Section 5b CAS80 YAML entry from `value: 30000.0` to `value: 0.03` and add a brief inline note that the unit is M$/year, consistent with the model framework convention used by all other overrides (which express values in M$ via the `generic.costs.*` multiplier pattern).
- **Priority:** important

### F-3: CAS70 override appears ineffective — native and generic values are identical
- **Target:** model_setup.py CAS70 override and model output
- **Category:** model
- **Finding:** The CAS70 override is set to `0.25 * generic.costs.cas70`, which should reduce native CAS70 to 25% of the generic value. However, the model output shows CAS70 = $2.4M for generic, native, and 1 GWe alike — no reduction is visible. If the framework treats annualized O&M differently from capital accounts (e.g., CAS70 is computed post-override or is not subject to the same override injection path), the override may be silently ignored. Either the override is not taking effect and the native LCOE is overstated on O&M, or the framework behavior needs to be documented so the analysis can account for it.
- **Recommendation:** Verify that the CAS70 override is being applied by the framework (check whether `run_native_and_1gw` injects operating-cost overrides the same way it injects capital-cost overrides). If the framework does not support CAS70 overrides, remove the CAS70 entry from both the analysis registry and the model's override list and note the limitation. If it does support them, investigate why the output shows no reduction and fix the override application.
- **Priority:** important

### Canonical account schema (for any new/changed override)

| Account | What it costs | Applies when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `C220101` | First wall, blanket & neutron multiplier (DT: tritium-breeding blanket; DD/aneutronic: energy-capture blanket) | always (for this archetype) |
| `C220102` | Radiation shield (sized to neutron wall loading; scales down for low-neutron fuels) | always (for this archetype) |
| `C220104` | Supplementary plasma heating (steady-state) or primary pulsed driver (laser/accelerator/gun) | primary pulsed driver (laser/accelerator/gun) on $/J of driver energy; electrical-drive concepts cost it in C220107 |
| `C220105` | Primary structure — gravity supports, thermal shields, inter-coil structure, machine base | always (for this archetype) |
| `C220106` | Vacuum system — vessel, port extensions, cryopumps, leak detection | always (for this archetype) |
| `C220107` | Power supplies (steady-state magnet supplies / switchgear) or pulsed-power capacitor bank ($/J stored) | pulsed-power capacitor bank on $/J stored — usually the dominant driver cost for electrically-driven pulsed schemes |
| `C220109` | Direct energy converter (electrostatic for mirror/FRC exhaust, or inductive DEC on a pulsed driver) | only if the design point uses direct energy conversion (directed axial exhaust or an inductive DEC stage) |
| `C220110` | Remote handling & maintenance equipment (rad-hardening tier x vessel geometry) | always (for this archetype) |
| `C220111` | Reactor-equipment installation & assembly (fraction of the CAS22 subtotal) | always (for this archetype) |
| `CAS21` | Buildings & site structures (reactor, turbine, hot cell, balance-of-plant) | always (for this archetype) |
| `CAS23` | Turbine plant equipment (thermal cycle; zero for direct-conversion / eta_th=0 plants) | zero if the design point is direct-conversion (no thermal cycle) |
| `CAS24` | Electric plant equipment (switchyard, transformers, plant distribution) | always (for this archetype) |
| `CAS26` | Heat rejection system (cooling towers, circulating water) | always (for this archetype) |
| `CAS27` | Special materials — initial reactor material inventory / blanket fill (distinct from C220101 structure) | always (for this archetype) |
| `CAS70` | Annualized O&M + scheduled component replacement (staffing-based) | always (for this archetype) |
| `CAS80` | Annualized fuel cost — consumables and enriched-isotope procurement | always (for this archetype) |

### Canonical `spec` field glossary (for any new/changed spec key)

If your edit touches the `spec` dict (adding/renaming/replacing a field),
the new key MUST come from the glossary below. Read the "Common confusions"
block before editing — most prior errors (concept 05/09 fusion-vs-heating
mix-up, dipole `plasma_volume` regression, kJ-vs-MJ driver-energy mistakes)
trace back to ignoring these warnings.
