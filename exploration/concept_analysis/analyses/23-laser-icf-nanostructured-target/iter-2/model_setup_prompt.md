# 1costingfe Model Update: Laser ICF Nanostructured Target (Marvel Fusion)

## Mode: Feedback Pass (Edit Existing Model)

An existing three-forward model from a prior iteration has been copied to `C:\Users\mallo\Deterministic_Concept_scoring\fusion-tea\exploration\concept_analysis\analyses\23-laser-icf-nanostructured-target\iter-2\model_setup.py`.

**Your task**: Read the existing model at `C:\Users\mallo\Deterministic_Concept_scoring\fusion-tea\exploration\concept_analysis\analyses\23-laser-icf-nanostructured-target\iter-2\model_setup.py` and apply
**targeted edits** based on the assessment findings below. Use the Edit tool — do
NOT rewrite the file from scratch, and do NOT restructure conforming code.

## Preserve the three-forward contract

The file already follows the canonical shape; keep it:
1. `spec` dict (design-point inputs only) + `P_native`
2. `model = CostModel(...)`
3. `generic = generic_reference(model, spec, P_native)` — the mandatory
   overrides-off forward (forward 1), the reference a relative override is written against
4. `overrides = [ ... ]` — six-field registry entries
5. `native, result_1gw = run_native_and_1gw(model, spec=spec, overrides=overrides, p_native=P_native)`

with `model`, `generic`, `native`, `result_1gw` at module level and the
`print_cas_breakdown(generic, native, result_1gw, overrides)` call retained. Do
not convert the helper call into an inline two-knob `forward()` (the contract
validator rejects it), do not drop the mandatory `generic` line, and do not
re-introduce `# DEFAULT:` comments or the uniform financial parameters
(`availability`, `lifetime_yr`, `interest_rate`, `inflation_rate`) into `spec`.
**Do not re-introduce power-conversion efficiencies (`eta_th`, `eta_de`,
`eta_dec`) into `spec`** — these are ENUM-driven; the way to express a
different value is to add an upstream ENUM member in costingfe, not a per-
concept override. `f_dec` (DEC fraction) MAY appear in `spec` with provenance —
it's a physics+architecture property, not a hardware-efficiency claim.
A relative override references `generic` (never `native` or `result_1gw`).

**Low archetype-fit concepts: do not empty `spec`.** When the frontmatter
declares `Archetype-Fit: Low`, the prior model may still have a populated `spec`
expressing the concept's actual geometry / physics using canonical kwargs (even
where the archetype isn't a perfect cost match). **Preserve those entries** and
only edit specific fields if a finding calls for it. Replacing a populated
low-fit `spec` with `spec = dict()` is a regression — the library would fall
back to pure archetype YAML defaults that carry zero signal for this concept's
actual machine. Cost-side overrides (the registry below) are where the "Low
fit" caveat properly lives.

**Archetype-specific spec key blocklist (library-bug workarounds).** Until library issues are
fixed, some spec keys must not be passed for specific archetypes — even when the published design
point has a value for them. If the prior model contains any of these keys in `spec`, **remove
them** as part of this edit:
- **DIPOLE**: remove `plasma_volume` if present. The MFE radiation calc treats `plasma_volume`
  as a uniform integrator and over-counts radiation for dipole-peaked profiles. Library issue:
  **1cFE/1costingfe#24**. Document the removal with a brief comment citing the issue.

**Override values are M$, never raw dollars** (validator rejects `|value| > 5e4`).
**Derived rollup accounts cannot be overridden**: C220111, C220000, C220100,
C220200, C220300, C220400, C220500, C220600, C220700. To express "this concept
assembles more simply," override `installation_frac` via `costing_overrides`,
not the C220111 dollar amount.
**Disabled overrides must carry a `blocked_by` field** matching `<org>/<repo>#<NN>`
(e.g. `"1cFE/1costingfe#42"`) so library-side findings route to a tracker
instead of dying in the rationale text.
**Every override must declare `cost_basis: "noak"` (strict).** The framework runs
`noak=True`; any other vintage (`foak`, `conceptual_design`, `vendor_target`,
`unspecified`) is rejected. If your source publishes a non-NOAK value, either
(a) disable + `blocked_by`, (b) apply a documented learning-curve adjustment in
`rationale` and declare `cost_basis: "noak"`, or (c) file a tracker issue.

**Rules**:
- Preserve all existing sweeps, scenarios, and sensitivity analyses unless a
  finding specifically says to change them.
- Add content incrementally; every change must be traceable to a specific finding
  or a direct consequence of one.
- Any override you add or change uses a **canonical** account code (schema below)
  and the six-field shape; keep `provenance` honest and show derivation arithmetic
  in `rationale`.


## Assessment Findings

Focus on findings tagged `Category: model`. Findings tagged `Category: analysis`
are informational (the analysis agent handles prose), but you may adjust model
parameters if an analysis finding implies the model's assumptions are wrong.

### F-1: Absolute overrides on C220104 and C220108 are sized at 100 MWe and do not scale to 1 GWe, understating the projected LCOE
- **Target:** model_setup.py overrides list (C220104, C220108)
- **Category:** model
- **Finding:** The C220104 (driver) override is $500M, derived from "50 beamlines × $10M/beamline" at the 100 MWe pilot scale. The C220108 (target factory) override is $31.5M, sized for 315M targets/year at 10 Hz for one 100 MWe module. Both are absolute dollar values that pass through unchanged to the 1 GWe projection. However, a 1 GWe plant requires 10 modules (10 × 100 MWe), meaning ~500 laser beamlines and ~3.15B targets/year. The analysis itself quotes the source: "An actual power plant is expected to need around 500 laser systems," and the LLNL target is "<$1.5B for a GW-class plant." At 1 GWe the driver cost should be on the order of $1.5–5B and the target factory should scale roughly proportionally, yet the model applies $500M and $31.5M respectively. This causes the 1 GWe CAS22 total ($5,949M) to understate the laser-driver and target-factory contributions by potentially $1–4.5B, and the 1 GWe LCOE (445 $/MWh) is correspondingly too low for this concept.
- **Recommendation:** Either (a) express C220104 and C220108 as per-module values that the helper scales by module count (the way fractional overrides already scale), or (b) re-derive the absolute values at the 1 GWe scale (e.g., C220104 ≈ $1.5–3B for ~500 beamlines with NOAK learning, C220108 ≈ $100–200M for a 10× larger target fab). Document the scaling basis in the rationale so the native and 1 GWe figures are independently defensible.
- **Priority:** blocking

### F-2: C220101 blanket override claims consistency with concept 04 while applying a 2.3× more aggressive reduction
- **Target:** Section 5b (Override Candidates), C220101 rationale
- **Category:** analysis
- **Finding:** The C220101 override applies a 0.30× multiplier (70% cost reduction) and the rationale states it is "Consistent with concept 04-laser-icf override (0.70× applied to same account for same reasoning)." A 0.30× multiplier is a 70% reduction; concept 04's 0.70× is a 30% reduction. The word "consistent" is self-contradictory — Marvel's reduction is 2.3× more aggressive than the comparable's, applied to the same account for what the analysis itself calls "the same reasoning." No additional rationale is given for why Marvel's aneutronic blanket should cost 70% less than the DT default while HB11's aneutronic blanket costs only 30% less. Both share the p-B11 fuel cycle and both eliminate tritium breeding.
- **Recommendation:** Either (a) align the multiplier with concept 04 (0.70×) since the physical reasoning is identical (both aneutronic, both eliminate breeding, both retain thermal management structure), or (b) provide a concrete justification for why Marvel's blanket deserves a deeper reduction than HB11's — citing a specific subsystem difference, not just the shared aneutronic fuel cycle.
- **Priority:** important

| `CAS80` | Annualized fuel cost — consumables and enriched-isotope procurement | always (for this archetype) |

### Canonical `spec` field glossary (for any new/changed spec key)

If your edit touches the `spec` dict (adding/renaming/replacing a field),
the new key MUST come from the glossary below. Read the "Common confusions"
block before editing — most prior errors (concept 05/09 fusion-vs-heating
mix-up, dipole `plasma_volume` regression, kJ-vs-MJ driver-energy mistakes)
trace back to ignoring these warnings.
