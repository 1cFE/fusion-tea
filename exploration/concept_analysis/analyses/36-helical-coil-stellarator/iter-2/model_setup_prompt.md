# 1costingfe Model Update: Helical-Coil Stellarator (HESTIA)

## Mode: Feedback Pass (Edit Existing Model)

An existing three-forward model from a prior iteration has been copied to `C:\Users\mallo\Deterministic_Concept_scoring\fusion-tea\exploration\concept_analysis\analyses\36-helical-coil-stellarator\iter-2\model_setup.py`.

**Your task**: Read the existing model at `C:\Users\mallo\Deterministic_Concept_scoring\fusion-tea\exploration\concept_analysis\analyses\36-helical-coil-stellarator\iter-2\model_setup.py` and apply
**targeted edits** based on the assessment findings below. Use the Edit tool — do
NOT rewrite the file from scratch, and do NOT restructure conforming code.

## Preserve the three-forward contract

The file already follows the canonical shape; keep it:
1. `spec` dict (design-point inputs only) + `P_native`
2. `model = CostModel(...)`
3. `generic = generic_reference(model, spec, P_native)` — the mandatory
   overrides-off forward (forward 1), the reference a relative override is written against
4. `overrides = [ ... ]` — six-field registry entries
5. `native, result_1gw = run_native_and_1gw(model, spec=spec, overrides=overrides, p_native=P_native)`

with `model`, `generic`, `native`, `result_1gw` at module level and the
`print_cas_breakdown(generic, native, result_1gw, overrides)` call retained. Do
not convert the helper call into an inline two-knob `forward()` (the contract
validator rejects it), do not drop the mandatory `generic` line, and do not
re-introduce `# DEFAULT:` comments or the uniform financial parameters
(`availability`, `lifetime_yr`, `interest_rate`, `inflation_rate`) into `spec`.
**Do not re-introduce power-conversion efficiencies (`eta_th`, `eta_de`,
`eta_dec`) into `spec`** — these are ENUM-driven; the way to express a
different value is to add an upstream ENUM member in costingfe, not a per-
concept override. `f_dec` (DEC fraction) MAY appear in `spec` with provenance —
it's a physics+architecture property, not a hardware-efficiency claim.
A relative override references `generic` (never `native` or `result_1gw`).

**Low archetype-fit concepts: do not empty `spec`.** When the frontmatter
declares `Archetype-Fit: Low`, the prior model may still have a populated `spec`
expressing the concept's actual geometry / physics using canonical kwargs (even
where the archetype isn't a perfect cost match). **Preserve those entries** and
only edit specific fields if a finding calls for it. Replacing a populated
low-fit `spec` with `spec = dict()` is a regression — the library would fall
back to pure archetype YAML defaults that carry zero signal for this concept's
actual machine. Cost-side overrides (the registry below) are where the "Low
fit" caveat properly lives.

**Archetype-specific spec key blocklist (library-bug workarounds).** Until library issues are
fixed, some spec keys must not be passed for specific archetypes — even when the published design
point has a value for them. If the prior model contains any of these keys in `spec`, **remove
them** as part of this edit:
- **DIPOLE**: remove `plasma_volume` if present. The MFE radiation calc treats `plasma_volume`
  as a uniform integrator and over-counts radiation for dipole-peaked profiles. Library issue:
  **1cFE/1costingfe#24**. Document the removal with a brief comment citing the issue.

**Override values are M$, never raw dollars** (validator rejects `|value| > 5e4`).
**Derived rollup accounts cannot be overridden**: C220111, C220000, C220100,
C220200, C220300, C220400, C220500, C220600, C220700. To express "this concept
assembles more simply," override `installation_frac` via `costing_overrides`,
not the C220111 dollar amount.
**Disabled overrides must carry a `blocked_by` field** matching `<org>/<repo>#<NN>`
(e.g. `"1cFE/1costingfe#42"`) so library-side findings route to a tracker
instead of dying in the rationale text.
**Every override must declare `cost_basis: "noak"` (strict).** The framework runs
`noak=True`; any other vintage (`foak`, `conceptual_design`, `vendor_target`,
`unspecified`) is rejected. If your source publishes a non-NOAK value, either
(a) disable + `blocked_by`, (b) apply a documented learning-curve adjustment in
`rationale` and declare `cost_basis: "noak"`, or (c) file a tracker issue.

**Rules**:
- Preserve all existing sweeps, scenarios, and sensitivity analyses unless a
  finding specifically says to change them.
- Add content incrementally; every change must be traceable to a specific finding
  or a direct consequence of one.
- Any override you add or change uses a **canonical** account code (schema below)
  and the six-field shape; keep `provenance` honest and show derivation arithmetic
  in `rationale`.


## Assessment Findings

Focus on findings tagged `Category: model`. Findings tagged `Category: analysis`
are informational (the analysis agent handles prose), but you may adjust model
parameters if an analysis finding implies the model's assumptions are wrong.

### F-1: Geometry parameter mismatch between analysis and model
- **Target:** Section 5 (Design Point Parameters table) and model_setup.py spec dict
- **Category:** model
- **Finding:** The analysis Section 5 table states R0 = 8.0 m and minor radius a = 2.0 m (lines 220-221), citing aip-2023-paper-abstract.md Table I. However, model_setup.py uses R0 = 7.8 m and plasma_t = 1.87 m (lines 27-28), also claiming to cite the same source. This is a design-point coherence failure — the model computes costs for a different geometry than the analysis describes. The coherence flags report "P_native coherent at 70.4 MWe (3-leg)" but do not catch geometry drift because P_native can be achieved at multiple geometries with different B/p_input combinations.
- **Recommendation:** Read the actual source (aip-2023-paper-abstract.md Table I) to determine the correct values. Update either the analysis Section 5 table or the model_setup.py spec to match the authoritative source. Both artifacts must describe the same machine. If the source is ambiguous or contains multiple design points, choose one consistently and document which was selected in both the analysis Design Point block and the model comments.
- **Priority:** blocking

### Canonical `spec` field glossary (for any new/changed spec key)

If your edit touches the `spec` dict (adding/renaming/replacing a field),
the new key MUST come from the glossary below. Read the "Common confusions"
block before editing — most prior errors (concept 05/09 fusion-vs-heating
mix-up, dipole `plasma_volume` regression, kJ-vs-MJ driver-energy mistakes)
trace back to ignoring these warnings.
