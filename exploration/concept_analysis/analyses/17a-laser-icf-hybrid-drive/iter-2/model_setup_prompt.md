# 1costingfe Model Update: Laser ICF Hybrid Drive (Xcimer Energy)

## Mode: Feedback Pass (Edit Existing Model)

An existing three-forward model from a prior iteration has been copied to `C:\Users\mallo\Deterministic_Concept_scoring\fusion-tea\exploration\concept_analysis\analyses\17a-laser-icf-hybrid-drive\iter-2\model_setup.py`.

**Your task**: Read the existing model at `C:\Users\mallo\Deterministic_Concept_scoring\fusion-tea\exploration\concept_analysis\analyses\17a-laser-icf-hybrid-drive\iter-2\model_setup.py` and apply
**targeted edits** based on the assessment findings below. Use the Edit tool — do
NOT rewrite the file from scratch, and do NOT restructure conforming code.

## Preserve the three-forward contract

The file already follows the canonical shape; keep it:
1. `spec` dict (design-point inputs only) + `P_native`
2. `model = CostModel(...)`
3. `generic = generic_reference(model, spec, P_native)` — the mandatory
   overrides-off forward (forward 1), the reference a relative override is written against
4. `overrides = [ ... ]` — six-field registry entries
5. `native, result_1gw = run_native_and_1gw(model, spec=spec, overrides=overrides, p_native=P_native)`

with `model`, `generic`, `native`, `result_1gw` at module level and the
`print_cas_breakdown(generic, native, result_1gw, overrides)` call retained. Do
not convert the helper call into an inline two-knob `forward()` (the contract
validator rejects it), do not drop the mandatory `generic` line, and do not
re-introduce `# DEFAULT:` comments or the uniform financial parameters
(`availability`, `lifetime_yr`, `interest_rate`, `inflation_rate`) into `spec`.
**Do not re-introduce power-conversion efficiencies (`eta_th`, `eta_de`,
`eta_dec`) into `spec`** — these are ENUM-driven; the way to express a
different value is to add an upstream ENUM member in costingfe, not a per-
concept override. `f_dec` (DEC fraction) MAY appear in `spec` with provenance —
it's a physics+architecture property, not a hardware-efficiency claim.
A relative override references `generic` (never `native` or `result_1gw`).

**Low archetype-fit concepts: do not empty `spec`.** When the frontmatter
declares `Archetype-Fit: Low`, the prior model may still have a populated `spec`
expressing the concept's actual geometry / physics using canonical kwargs (even
where the archetype isn't a perfect cost match). **Preserve those entries** and
only edit specific fields if a finding calls for it. Replacing a populated
low-fit `spec` with `spec = dict()` is a regression — the library would fall
back to pure archetype YAML defaults that carry zero signal for this concept's
actual machine. Cost-side overrides (the registry below) are where the "Low
fit" caveat properly lives.

**Archetype-specific spec key blocklist (library-bug workarounds).** Until library issues are
fixed, some spec keys must not be passed for specific archetypes — even when the published design
point has a value for them. If the prior model contains any of these keys in `spec`, **remove
them** as part of this edit:
- **DIPOLE**: remove `plasma_volume` if present. The MFE radiation calc treats `plasma_volume`
  as a uniform integrator and over-counts radiation for dipole-peaked profiles. Library issue:
  **1cFE/1costingfe#24**. Document the removal with a brief comment citing the issue.

**Override values are M$, never raw dollars** (validator rejects `|value| > 5e4`).
**Derived rollup accounts cannot be overridden**: C220111, C220000, C220100,
C220200, C220300, C220400, C220500, C220600, C220700. To express "this concept
assembles more simply," override `installation_frac` via `costing_overrides`,
not the C220111 dollar amount.
**Disabled overrides must carry a `blocked_by` field** matching `<org>/<repo>#<NN>`
(e.g. `"1cFE/1costingfe#42"`) so library-side findings route to a tracker
instead of dying in the rationale text.
**Every override must declare `cost_basis: "noak"` (strict).** The framework runs
`noak=True`; any other vintage (`foak`, `conceptual_design`, `vendor_target`,
`unspecified`) is rejected. If your source publishes a non-NOAK value, either
(a) disable + `blocked_by`, (b) apply a documented learning-curve adjustment in
`rationale` and declare `cost_basis: "noak"`, or (c) file a tracker issue.

**Rules**:
- Preserve all existing sweeps, scenarios, and sensitivity analyses unless a
  finding specifically says to change them.
- Add content incrementally; every change must be traceable to a specific finding
  or a direct consequence of one.
- Any override you add or change uses a **canonical** account code (schema below)
  and the six-field shape; keep `provenance` honest and show derivation arithmetic
  in `rationale`.


## Assessment Findings

Focus on findings tagged `Category: model`. Findings tagged `Category: analysis`
are informational (the analysis agent handles prose), but you may adjust model
parameters if an analysis finding implies the model's assumptions are wrong.

### F-1: C220104 override value is $960M (FOAK) in analysis but $560M (NOAK) in model — cross-artifact drift
- **Target:** Section 5b (Override Candidates) — C220104 entry
- **Category:** analysis
- **Finding:** The analysis Section 5b YAML sets `value: 960.0` using the FOAK upper bound ($120/J × 8 MJ), while `model_setup.py` uses `value: 560.0` (NOAK midpoint $70/J × 8 MJ). Both carry `provenance: direct`. The model comment explains the switch ("cost_basis must be 'noak'"), but the analysis YAML — which is the canonical override registry — still records the FOAK figure. A reader comparing the two artifacts sees a $400M discrepancy on the single largest cost account with no reconciliation in the analysis text.
- **Recommendation:** Change the analysis Section 5b C220104 `value` to the NOAK figure (560.0) to match the model, or add a second `value_noak` field and note that the model uses the NOAK value. The rationale already contains the NOAK range ($60–$80/J); make the `value` field consistent with what the model actually uses. Keep `provenance: direct` — the NOAK range is also company-published.
- **Priority:** important

### F-2: Q_eng spec value (8.2) describes NOAK performance, not the Athena pilot at its native 5% WPE
- **Target:** model_setup.py spec dict and Section 5 parameter table
- **Category:** model
- **Finding:** The spec uses `q_eng=8.2`, which the model comments acknowledge is the "NOAK target" at 7% laser WPE and 250 target gain. But Athena is a pilot-demonstrator with stated 5% WPE, which the analysis itself estimates would yield Q_eng ~5–6. Using 8.2 in the spec inflates the net-to-gross conversion: the plant produces more net electricity per unit fusion power than the actual Athena design can deliver, making both the native and 1 GWe LCOE appear more favorable than they should. The analysis Section 5 table correctly flags this ("Athena with ~5% eff would be lower") but the model does not use the native-consistent value. This is a design-point coherence issue — the spec claims to describe Athena at native scale but uses a physics parameter that Athena cannot achieve.
- **Recommendation:** Use a Q_eng value consistent with Athena's stated 5% WPE (approximately 5.5–6, derived from the whitepaper's recirculating-power-fraction formula at 5% efficiency). If the intent is to model the NOAK-maturity version of this architecture at 400 MWe, the Design-Point-Maturity field should say so; otherwise, the spec should match the pilot-demonstrator's actual performance. Add a sensitivity sweep over Q_eng = [5.5, 6.5, 8.2] to show the LCOE impact of the WPE assumption.
- **Priority:** blocking

| `CAS24` | Electric plant equipment (switchyard, transformers, plant distribution) | always (for this archetype) |
| `CAS26` | Heat rejection system (cooling towers, circulating water) | always (for this archetype) |
| `CAS27` | Special materials — initial reactor material inventory / blanket fill (distinct from C220101 structure) | always (for this archetype) |
| `CAS70` | Annualized O&M + scheduled component replacement (staffing-based) | always (for this archetype) |
| `CAS80` | Annualized fuel cost — consumables and enriched-isotope procurement | always (for this archetype) |

### Canonical `spec` field glossary (for any new/changed spec key)

If your edit touches the `spec` dict (adding/renaming/replacing a field),
the new key MUST come from the glossary below. Read the "Common confusions"
block before editing — most prior errors (concept 05/09 fusion-vs-heating
mix-up, dipole `plasma_volume` regression, kJ-vs-MJ driver-energy mistakes)
trace back to ignoring these warnings.
