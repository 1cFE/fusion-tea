# Override semantics and the 1 GWe headline

## The invariant (this is the whole rule)

Every concept's headline is one number: LCOE for a **1 GWe NOAK plant**, reached
by **replicating** the real `P_native` design point into a fleet of `n_mod`
identical modules (`run_native_and_1gw(...)`, `noak=True`). There is no monolithic
1 GWe machine — we never extrapolate the physics model to a single 1000 MWe
reactor we have no design basis for.

At that headline, for **every account in every class**:

    account = M × (the library's 1 GWe fleet cost for that account)

`M` is the fraction of the library's fleet answer you believe this concept should
pay. `M = 1.0` means "trust the library default"; you only write an override when
evidence says this concept departs from it. That is the entire authoring rule.

The framework guarantees this invariant regardless of *which* `generic` value you
anchor to: `_scale_overrides` (in `1costingfe/src/costingfe/model.py`) rescales
your override from the native frame to the fleet frame by the per-account ratio
`fleet_cost / native_cost`, so the headline always lands on `M × fleet_cost`. You
do **not** compute that ratio yourself — you pick the right `generic` anchor for
the account's storage shape (below) and the framework does the rest.

## The cost classes — comprehension, not three rules

The classes below explain **why** the fleet cost is what it is (so you can sanity-
check `M`) and dictate the **authoring shape** — which `generic` value you anchor
to. They do **not** introduce per-class multipliers. If you delete the table, the
invariant above still tells you what an override means; the table only tells you
*where to anchor it* and *why the fleet cost looks the way it does*.

| Class | Why the fleet cost is what it is | Authoring shape (what to anchor to) | Accounts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S — Shared / fixed** | A site needs these **once**, however many modules it runs — the library charges them once across the fleet. That single charge *is* the amortization that gives a small machine a fair shot. | whole-plant M$ → `M * generic.costs.<rollup>` | CAS10, CAS21, CAS28, CAS40, CAS70 |
| **U — Per-unit** | One per module: `N` modules → `N` cores. The library multiplies by `n_mod`; `noak=True` credits mass-production learning as the offset for losing single-core economy of scale. | per-module M$ → `M * generic.cas22_detail["C2201xx"]` | CAS22 reactor-island sub-accounts `C2201xx`; CAS80 fuel (taught, but not overridable today — see note) |
| **P — Power-proportional** | Scales with the **total** plant power, so the value is the same whether you replicate or not. | whole-plant M$ → `M * generic.costs.<rollup>` | CAS23, CAS24, CAS25, CAS26, CAS27; plant-wide CAS22 sub-accounts `C2202xx`–`C2207xx` |

**Storage-shape footnotes (which `generic` attribute exists):**
- Only the CAS22 reactor-island sub-accounts (`C2201xx`) live under
  `generic.cas22_detail["C220xxx"]`. Everything else — CAS21, CAS23–27, CAS70,
  CAS80, and the CAS22 rollup — is a top-level attribute on `generic.costs`.
- **Taught but NOT overridable today: CAS40 (owner's costs), CAS70 (O&M), and
  CAS80 (fuel).** Overrides on these are silently dropped — e.g. a CAS80 override,
  whether absolute (`0.050`) or relative (`M * generic.costs.cas80`), leaves the
  fleet value at the library default and does **not** move the headline
  (`1cFE/1costingfe#106`; the CAS70 / CAS80 no-op is pinned by
  `1costingfe/tests/test_override_scaling_semantics.py`). They are in the class
  table so you know *why* the library prices them as it does (and so a future
  override surface lands on prepared ground) — but do **not** author an override
  against them expecting an effect. Use only codes from the canonical account
  schema you are given.

**Reading the output — how to verify a Class-U override actually scaled:**
The `print_cas_breakdown` **CAS22 sub-account detail table shows per-module M$ at
every scale** — its `native` (n_mod=1) and `1 GWe` (n_mod=200) columns are
*supposed to be identical* for a `C2201xx` row, because the per-module cost does not
change; the ×`n_mod` fleet multiplication shows up in the **`C220000` / `CAS22`
rollup**, not in the detail row. So a Class-U detail row that reads the same at
native and 1 GWe is **expected, not a scaling failure.** To confirm a Class-U
override reached the fleet, check that the **`CAS22` (or `C220000`) rollup** moved
by roughly `Δ(per-module value) × n_mod` — never infer "it didn't scale" from the
detail row alone.

## The rationale baseline (one named frame, always)

Every relative override's `rationale` answers "why is `M` what it is?" against
**one** named baseline:

> **the library's default for a fleet of this device at 1 GWe.**

Never against "a conventional 1 GWe plant" / a monolithic 1000 MWe machine — under
the always-replicate decision that baseline does not exist. Anchor the rationale
to the same frame as the value. (Citing a monolithic plant from the literature as
a *comparable* — ARC, STEP — is fine; using one as the override's *anchor
baseline* is the inconsistency this policy removes.)

A multiplier above 1.0 is legitimate: it means "this concept's account costs more
than the library's modular-fleet default" (e.g. a harder-to-build module), still
in the fleet frame — not "more than a conventional plant."

## What wrong looks like

- **Value/rationale frame mismatch.** Value reads `0.70 * generic.cas22_detail["C220101"]`
  (70% of one module's blanket) while the rationale says "70% of a conventional
  1 GWe plant's blanket." The value is per-module fleet-frame; the rationale is
  monolithic. Rewrite the rationale in the modular-fleet frame.
- **Monolithic baseline in rationale.** Any "vs a conventional / standard 1 GWe
  plant," "vs a monolithic reactor," or bare "vs library default" with no fleet
  frame. Replace with "vs the library's 1 GWe modular-fleet default."
- **Class/anchor mismatch.** Overriding a CAS22 sub-account (Class U) but anchoring
  to a top-level rollup (e.g. `C220101` valued against `generic.costs.cas21`).
  Anchor each account to its own storage location: `C2201xx` →
  `generic.cas22_detail["C2201xx"]`; top-level rollups → `generic.costs.<rollup>`.
