"""The operator guide is walked by strangers, so what it must contain is a test.

SC6 is judged by a fresh session that did not build the seam. That judgement is not
automatable, but its preconditions are: a guide missing a condition slug, an environment
variable or an exit code cannot possibly pass the walk, and it should fail here first
rather than waste the walk. These tests check the guide is complete, not that it is good.
