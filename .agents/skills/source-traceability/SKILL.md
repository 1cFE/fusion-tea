# Source Traceability

The durable traceability chain, citation patterns, SOURCE_INDEX format, and traceability matrix schema.

## Core Principle

Every model element traces to an authority source. Traceability is recorded during implementation as a byproduct of work, not as a separate phase. The chain uses only durable artifacts — per-work-item specs are where traceability is discovered, but durable project files are where it lives.

## When to Reference

- `/implement-model` — recording source citations in doc comments and traceability matrix
- `/design-model` — parameter extraction with source attribution
- `/spec-model` — defining traceability requirements for success criteria
- `/audit-models` — verifying traceability completeness and baseline comparison
- `/research` — domain source investigation and citation patterns
- `/manage-sources` — configuring authority sources in SOURCE_INDEX.md

## The Durable Traceability Chain

```
DI-XXX (domain insight, in KNOWLEDGE.md)
   |
   | Source column in REQUIREMENTS.md
   v
PR-XXX (promoted requirement, in REQUIREMENTS.md)
   |
   | Requirement column in traceability_matrix.csv
   v
Model element (part def, calc def, constraint)
   |
   | Source/Reference fields in doc comment
   v
Authority source (file:line in codebase, section in spec doc)
```

Each node is a durable artifact. Per-work-item spec.md files may reference these IDs but are not part of the durable chain — they are ephemeral and archived when work completes.

## SOURCE_INDEX.md Format

Location: `knowledge/SOURCE_INDEX.md`

Each source entry follows this format:

```markdown
### [Source Name]
- **Type**: codebase | documentation | database | reference
- **Location**: path or URL
- **Use For**: what questions this source answers
- **Validation**: how to verify against this source, or "N/A"
```

**Source types**:

| Type | Description | How Commands Use It |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `codebase` | Code repository | Launch Explore agents to analyze |
| `documentation` | PDF, markdown, text files | Read/search for relevant sections |
| `database` | API or database endpoint | Query for data |
| `reference` | Books, papers, standards | Note for citations, don't deep-analyze |

## Doc Comment Content Requirements

Every `part def`, `calc def`, and `constraint def` requires a doc comment with three fields:

| Field | What It Must Contain | Example |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| **Source** | The authority document or codebase that justifies this element | `Reference codebase power balance module` |
| **Reference** | Specific locator within the source | `power_balance.py:94-102` |
| **Last Updated** | Date when the citation was last verified | `2026-01-28` |

For doc comment syntax and format, see the **sysml-conventions** skill.

## Citation Patterns

| Source Type | Citation Pattern | Example |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| Codebase | `file.py:line X-Y` or `module/file.py:function_name` | `DefineInputs.py:45-48` |
| Documentation | `Document Name, Section X.Y` | `ITER Physics Basis, Section 4.2` |
| Online | `URL (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)` | `https://example.com (accessed 2026-01-15)` |
| Standard | `Standard ID, Section/Clause` | `ISO 19514:2017, Clause 7.3` |
| Research | `knowledge/research/approved/YYYYMMDD_topic.md` | `knowledge/research/approved/20260115_thermal.md` |

**Codebase citations must include line numbers** for parameters extracted from code. This enables automated verification during audits.

## Traceability Matrix Schema

Location: `data/traceability_matrix.csv`

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Element | Model element name | `ThermalSystemCostCalc` |
| File | SysML file path | `models/library/analyses/thermal_cost.sysml` |
| Type | Element kind | `calc def` |
| Knowledge | DI-XXX IDs this traces to | `DI-003, DI-012` |
| Requirement | PR-XXX IDs this satisfies | `PR-005` |
| Source_Type | Authority source kind | `codebase` |
| Source_Document | Authority source name | `ReferenceImpl` |
| Source_Location | Specific location | `thermal_cost.py:94` |
| Confidence | Assessment level | `High` |
| Assumptions | Known approximations | `Uses 2024 material costs` |
| Last_Verified | Date of last audit | `2026-01-28` |

Both `Knowledge` (DI-XXX) and `Requirement` (PR-XXX) columns may be populated. The Knowledge column enables direct impact queries when a domain insight is superseded. The Requirement column enables coverage checking.

## When to Record Traceability

Traceability is recorded **during implementation**, not after:

| When | What to Record | Where |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Writing a definition | Source and Reference in doc comment | Doc comment fields |
| Completing a model element | Element → PR-XXX and DI-XXX links | `data/traceability_matrix.csv` |
| Promoting a requirement | MR-XXX → PR-XXX with source | `modeling_project/REQUIREMENTS.md` |

The `trace-element` AP-7 script handles mechanical recording. The agent supplies content; the script enforces schema, prevents duplicates, and validates that PR-XXX and DI-XXX IDs exist.

## Confidence Assessment

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **High** | Direct extraction from authority source with exact values; verified by audit |
| **Medium** | Derived from authority source with interpretation or unit conversion; consistent with source |
| **Low** | Estimated, interpolated, or from secondary sources; needs verification |

## Anti-Patterns

| Instead of | Do |
|------------|-----|
| Recording traceability as a separate phase after implementation | Record during implementation — it's a byproduct of work |
| Citing "the codebase" without specifics | Cite `file.py:line X-Y` with exact locations |
| Skipping doc comments on definitions | Every def needs Source, Reference, Last Updated |
| Relying on per-work-item specs for traceability | Use durable artifacts: REQUIREMENTS.md, traceability_matrix.csv |
| Leaving Confidence blank | Assess as High/Medium/Low — enables prioritized verification |
| Omitting Last_Verified date | Always record when citation was last checked |
