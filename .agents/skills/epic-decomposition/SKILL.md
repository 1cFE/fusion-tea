# Epic Decomposition

Scale taxonomy, work item sizing, and decomposition process for modeling work.

## Core Principle

Decompose by **domain concern**, not by workflow phase or validation level. Each work item should model one domain subsystem end-to-end, be independently validatable, and produce clear deliverables. The overhead of the workflow (spec/design/plan/implement) must be proportionate to the work.

## When to Reference

- `/backlog` — when adding work items or decomposing epics
- `/spec-model` — when scoping a work item (is this the right size?)
- `/onboard` — when planning initial project work

## Scale Taxonomy

| Scale | Behavior | Entry Point | Tracking |
|-------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Trivial** | Direct change + validate. No spec/design/plan. | `/quick-model` | No work item directory. Not tracked in PM. |
| **Standard** | Full pipeline: spec → design → plan → implement. Agent adjusts depth naturally. | `/spec-model` | `work/active/WI-XXX_{name}/` directory |
| **Epic** | Must decompose into standard sub-items before execution. | `/backlog decompose` | Epic file in `work/backlog/epic-{name}.md` |

**Routing**: The system infers scale from scope description and confirms with the user. Power users can state scale directly.

**Examples**:
- Trivial: Fix a naming convention violation; update a constant from a source revision
- Standard: Model a costing subsystem; integrate power balance with a plant subsystem
- Epic: End-to-end costing pipeline across all subsystems; full system model with multiple configurations

## Goldilocks Indicators

### Too Large (needs decomposition into epic)

- Spans multiple domain subsystems that could be modeled independently
- Depends on 4+ authority sources
- Would produce 25+ new definitions (part defs, calc defs, constraint defs)
- Success criteria mix structural, validation, and codegen concerns
- Cannot describe scope without referencing multiple architectural decisions (AD-XXX)

### Too Small (doesn't need the full workflow)

- Single definition change or addition
- No new interfaces or cross-file dependencies
- Success criteria are a single validation check
- Spec/design/plan overhead would exceed the work itself

### Just Right (standard work item)

- Models one domain subsystem or concern end-to-end
- Depends on 1-3 authority sources
- Produces 5-20 new definitions
- Can be validated independently through applicable validation levels
- A change to a domain insight (DI-XXX) affecting this item would be localized, not cascading

## Decomposition Process

### Step 1: Review Epic Scope

What domain concern does this epic address? Which project goals (G-XXX) does it serve? What architectural decisions (AD-XXX) constrain it? Read `modeling_project/OVERVIEW.md` and `modeling_project/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Step 2: Identify Authority Source Dependencies

List sources from `knowledge/SOURCE_INDEX.md` that constrain the work. Flag unstable sources that need `/research` before items can proceed. Authority sources shape the model from the start — discovering a source conflict mid-implementation causes rework.

### Step 3: Sketch Sub-Items by Domain Concern

Decompose by domain subsystem or model package — NOT by workflow phase (spec/design/plan) and NOT by validation level. Each item produces a complete, independently-validatable piece of the model. Align with architectural decisions (AD-XXX): items should respect package boundaries.

### Step 4: Check Each Item's Independence

For each candidate item, verify:
- Can it be spec'd, designed, and implemented without waiting for other items?
- Does it produce clear deliverables (model files, tests)?
- Is the scope right-sized per the Goldilocks indicators?

### Step 5: Define Success Criteria and Sequencing

Each item gets high-level success criteria — MR-XXX candidates that `/spec-model` will refine. Map dependencies between items. Identify the critical path.

For PR-XXX format used in success criteria, see the **requirements-tracking** skill.

## Epic File Structure

Location: `work/backlog/epic-{name}.md`

```yaml
---
Status: draft | active | completed
Priority: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
Goal: G-XXX
Created: YYYY-MM-DD
Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

**Body sections**: Executive Summary, Context (G-XXX, DI-XXX, AD-XXX links), Authority Source Dependencies, Success Criteria, Items (per-item breakdowns with dependencies), Sequencing (dependency map, critical path), Risks.

**Relationship to BACKLOG.md**: BACKLOG.md is the dashboard (summary of all epics with status). Epic files hold the decomposition detail. When a sub-item moves to execution, it gets a `work/active/WI-XXX_{name}/` directory.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Phase-as-item** ("Item 1: Design. Item 2: Implement.") | Each item should go through its own full workflow cycle |
| **Validation-level decomposition** ("Item 1: L1-3. Item 2: L4-6.") | Levels are quality gates, not separable units of work |
| **Separating authority sources** ("Item 1: Structure. Item 2: Data.") | Sources constrain models from the start; integrate together |
| **Ignoring AD-XXX boundaries** | Items should respect package boundaries from ARCHITECTURE.md |
| **Vague success criteria** ("Models are complete") | Reference specific domain constraints, SV-XXX entries |
| **No goal traceability** | Every epic must link to G-XXX goals in OVERVIEW.md |
