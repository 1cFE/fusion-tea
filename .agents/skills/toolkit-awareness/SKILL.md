Before executing this skill, read `.agentic-mbse/claude.md` in Claude Code or `.agentic-mbse/codex.md` in Codex. Resolve supporting paths from this skill’s installed directory; keep generated outputs in the project or a temporary directory. Read referenced skills from `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` when their guidance is needed.

# Toolkit Awareness

Ensure accurate knowledge of the project's installed tools before answering questions about validation, workflow, pipeline steps, or available commands.

## Core Principle

Never guess or fabricate CLI commands, validation steps, or workflow processes. Always ground answers in the project's actual `README.md` and installed toolchain.

## When This Skill Triggers

- Questions about validation, quality checks, or model correctness
- Questions about the project pipeline or workflow stages
- Questions about available CLI commands or slash commands
- Any time a shell command would be suggested to the user
- Planning or describing build/CI/pipeline processes

## Required Actions

### Before Answering Tooling Questions

1. **Read `README.md`** at the project root. This is the authoritative source for:
   - CLI commands and their flags
   - The 6-level validation framework
   - Slash commands available in Claude Code
   - Project setup and environment requirements

2. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** at the project root. This documents:
   - Python environment rules (`uv` requirement)
   - MBSE workflow steps
   - Domain sources and how to reference them

3. **Check the 4-directory architecture** — see the Project Files section below for key files in `knowledge/`, `modeling_project/`, `work/`, and `data/`.

4. **Do not invent commands.** If a tool or command is not documented in README.md or CLAUDE.md, do not suggest it exists.

### Validation Framework

The project uses `agentic-mbse validate` with 6 quality levels. For complete details including level descriptions and blocking status, read the "Validation Framework" section of `README.md`.

Invocation patterns:
```bash
# All levels, fail-fast (default)
uv run agentic-mbse validate models/

# All levels, continue past failures
uv run agentic-mbse validate --complete models/

# Specific level only
uv run agentic-mbse validate --level=N models/

# Verbose diagnostics
uv run agentic-mbse validate --verbose models/
```

Do not suggest `uv run syside check` as a standalone validation step. Level 1 of `agentic-mbse validate` already runs syntax validation via syside. The 6-level framework is the correct entry point.

### CLI Tools

The primary CLI tool is `agentic-mbse`. Always invoke via `uv run`:
```bash
uv run agentic-mbse validate models/    # Validation
uv run agentic-mbse status              # Project status dashboard
uv run agentic-mbse pm <operation>      # Project management operations
uv run agentic-mbse --help              # Discover commands
```

Never use bare `python`, `pip`, `python3`, or `syside` without `uv run` prefix.

### PM Operations

All PM operations are atomic (mutations succeed fully or not at all) or tolerant (queries return partial results with warnings). Invoke via `uv run agentic-mbse pm <operation> [args]`.

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `close-item <name>` | Archive completed work item from active to completed |
| `approve-research <file> --insights '<json>'` | Approve pending research and register domain insights |
| `trace-element --element <name> --file <path> ...` | Record model element traceability to matrix |
| `promote-requirement --requirement <text> --source <ID>` | Promote per-item requirement to project-wide PR-XXX |
| `register-decision --title <text> --decision <text> --rationale <text>` | Record architectural decision as AD-XXX |
| `update-validation <SV-XXX> --status <status>` | Update verification criterion status |
| `add-insight --title <text> --source <source> ...` | Capture domain insight as DI-XXX during work |
| `impact-query <ID>` | Find model elements affected by DI-XXX or PR-XXX change |
| `supersede-insight <DI-XXX> --new-insight '<json>' --reason '<text>'` | Replace domain insight and report impact |

### Slash Commands

Consult `README.md` for full details. Complete command list grouped by function:

**Modeling Workflow:**

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/spec-model` | Define requirements and success criteria for models |
| `/design-model` | Make model architecture decisions |
| `/plan-model` | Create implementation plan with phases |
| `/implement-model` | Execute plan, write SysML |
| `/quick-model` | Understood local corrections with focused evidence |
| `/review-model` | Review model quality and correctness |
| `/formalize-intent` | Convert informal intent to formal SysML |

**Project Management:**

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/audit-models` | Validate models against domain sources |
| `/analyze-models` | Analyze model structure and dependencies |
| `/status` | Project status dashboard |
| `/backlog` | Work item management |
| `/onboard` | Initialize new MBSE project |

**Knowledge Management:**

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/research` | Deep-dive into domain knowledge |
| `/manage-sources` | Add/remove domain sources |

### Project Files

Key project files in the 4-directory architecture:

| File | Directory | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| `SOURCE_INDEX.md` | `knowledge/` | Registry of domain knowledge sources |
| `KNOWLEDGE.md` | `knowledge/` | Domain insights (DI-XXX) and research findings |
| `OVERVIEW.md` | `modeling_project/` | Project scope and high-level description |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | `modeling_project/` | Model architecture decisions |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | `modeling_project/` | Project-wide requirements (PR-XXX) |
| `VALIDATION_MATRIX.md` | `modeling_project/` | Verification criteria (SV-XXX) and status |
| `BACKLOG.md` | `work/` | Work items, epics, and priorities |
| `traceability_matrix.csv` | `data/` | Element-to-requirement traceability records |

### Python Environment

All Python commands require `uv run` prefix. This is a hard rule documented in `CLAUDE.md`. See `references/python-environment.md` for details.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| `syside check models/` | `uv run agentic-mbse validate models/` |
| `python script.py` | `uv run python script.py` |
| `pip install X` | `uv add X` |
| Inventing validation commands | Reading README.md first |
| Describing tools from memory | Reading README.md to confirm |
